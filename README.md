# Clinic
A Spring Boot application serving as a school project, demonstrating our understanding of the Spring framework


Imagine a service where Patients and Doctors meet so that Symptoms can be submitted, reviewed, and applied Diagnoses for the Patient to see later.
Using the following technologies, we were able to connect 2 types of Users via 3 tables with all data validated against constraints & authenticated, presented in an appealing UI that makes sense.

We used:

Spring Boot

Spring Security
MySQL (via MySQL Workbench)
Java (JDK 18)
Thymeleaf for templates and fragments
GitHub and GitHub Projects
and Microsoft VS Code as our editor

Written by a team of 3 contributors over 6 days in early November 2022.
